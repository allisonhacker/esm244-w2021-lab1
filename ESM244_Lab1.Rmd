```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

### Read in SF trees data

```{r}

sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data","sf_trees","sf_trees.csv"))

```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Data wrangling and summary statistics using functions in the `dplyr` package

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal status, wrangle, and make a graph.
```{r}

top_5_status <- sf_trees %>%
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
  relocate(tree_count) %>%
  slice_max(tree_count, n=5)
  
```
